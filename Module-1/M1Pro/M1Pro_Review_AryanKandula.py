# Pseudocode:
# Display a welcome message
# Ask the user for a country code
# Repeat until the user enters "stop"
#     If the country code is valid (US, CA, MX):
#         Ask for a statistic (pop, gdp, ccy, fx)
#         If the statistic is valid:
#             Look up and display the value
#         Else:
#             Show an invalid statistic message
#     Else if the country code is not stop:
#         Show an invalid country code message
# End the program when the user enters "stop"
